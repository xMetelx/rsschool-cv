## About Myself
I was an equiestrian coach.
I am an office manager.
I will be a frontend developer.

I like to study something new. One day I found out web-development, I felt in love with this amazing technology of making people`s internet surfing easier. I like web because I can see the result of my job immidiately, just refreshing a page. I like to find bugs and look for a solution and this divine feeling when the problem is solved.
